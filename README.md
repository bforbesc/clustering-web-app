# [✂️Clustering cross-sectional data](https://clustering-cross-sectional.herokuapp.com/)
The purpose of this app is to compute and plot clusters for your cross-sectional data. The app is written in Python using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and deployed to the web via [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/).

I assume you have a CSV file with your data **already cleaned** (i.e., without missing values, duplicates or string variables). The algorithms used are **KMeans** and **tSNE** to compute and visualize the clusters, respectively.

You can find the app here: [clustering-cross-sectional.herokuapp.com](https://clustering-cross-sectional.herokuapp.com/)[^1]
