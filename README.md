# [✂️ Clustering Cross-Sectional Data](https://clustering-cross-sectional.herokuapp.com/)
The purpose of this app is to compute and plot clusters for your cross-sectional data. The app is written in Python and deployed deployed to the web via [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

I assume you have a CSV file with your data **already cleaned** (i.e., without missing values, duplicates or string variables). The algorithms used are **KMeans** and **tSNE** to compute and visualize the clusters, respectively.

You can find the app here: [clustering-web-app.streamlit.app](https://clustering-web-app.streamlit.app)[^1]
